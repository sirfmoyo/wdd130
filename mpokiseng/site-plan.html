      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The aim of this site is to teach rural farmers on environmentally friendly agricultural practices. Sustainable agricultural practices are essential for producing our food yet protecting our environment and soil. Soil is a non-renewable resource which is a habitat to so many micro-organisms and animals. It is vital for many cycles of items such as water, carbon (dioxide) and nitrogen,
         it plays a pivotal for so many varied ecosystems, food sources and other resources.  </p>  <!-- change this -->

        Mpokiseng (Sechaba Saroona) is an initiative to make us aware of different ways of producing food in a sustainable way. Mpokiseng is a Sotho word which means assist me to thank, or make/force me to thank. Sechaba Saroona means our territory (country or community). It is with much pleasure and happiness to be interacting with you in our quest to save our environment (Sechaba Saroona), hence let us be thankful (Mpokiseng).
Sustainable food production mainly entails practices of producing food to meet the growing human population yet without causing harm or hurting our environment. It is our mandate as humans to be custodians of our environment, which we received as a gift from previous generations. This beautiful environment has been handed down by preceding generations to us because we are responsible enough to hand it over to future generations in a perfect state. To achieve our goal we need to:
1. Love our environment
2. Know of different agricultural production systems
3. Differentiate between production systems which harm the environment and those that protect it

      <h3>Loving our environment</h3>
      <p>
        
Our environment refers to the earth or soil and rocks which form the basis of most things found within it. This earth supports many plants, it is also home to many different animals and acts as a reservoir for underground water. It is also a source of so many precious elements.
Our environment also consists of a plethora of different plants. Trees are a habitat to different animals and birds. They provide food to humans and animals with different foods. We (humans) use plants for constructing our homes, fencing our fields and for making kraals for our animals. Trees also provide us with medicine, firewood and we use them for constructing different structures which include but are not limited to furniture, scotch carts and whipping sticks which are used for driving animals.
We have our beautiful water bodies (dams and rivers). They are habitats to different animals and birds and they provide us with water for our survival and the survival of animals, both wild and domesticated ones.
Know of different agricultural production systems.
Our community is an agro-based system, relying on animal production and crop production with few people who are formally employed. Our farming systems can be intensive or extensive animal and crop production. 
Differentiate between production systems which harm the environment and those that protect it.
Intensive production systems are associated with keeping a large number of animals within a small space, or producing many crops within a small area. This involves the application of heavy external inputs such as fertilizers, animal feeds and medicines. It is also associated with producing lots of wastes, which can be disposed of in different ways, depending on what is available. Intensive agricultural production systems are good because production can be  monitored and controlled, resulting in increased output (usually within a short period of time). This means that we can get more money, hence making agriculture a source of income, not just a means of survival. The downside of intensive agriculture is that these external inputs which we usually introduce, apart from protecting our produce, they also destroy our environment, kill or harm non-target organisms. The way we dispose of our wastes is usually not good. The painful thing about intensive is that it is also practiced by those with enough capital to buy inputs, but the resulting harm is for all community members.

      <h3>Optimised agricultural production methods</h3>
      <p>
        Those who want to venture into animal production (chickens, goats, pigs)
Breeds to consider
For poultry production one can consider venturing into broiler and or layer  production. Broilers are mainly kept for meat production as they grow at fast rate and have high feed conversion rates (FCR). They mature (attain a mass of 2kg) at between 6 to 8 weeksA high FCR implies that for a gram of feed they eat, most of it is converted to body tissue. The main broiler breeds in Zimbabwe are the Hamara Sasso, Cobb 500, and Ross.
Layers are chickens which are kept for egg production. When they start laying eggs they lay an egg every day. In Zimbabwe the common layer breeds are Hamara Sussex, White Leghorn, Brown Leghorn and Black Minorca
Calendar and Feed
These birds can be bought and reared at any time of the year. Broiler feed is available from the local shops, the city of Gwanda or from the City of Bulawayo. There are two broiler feeding phases:
Three phase feeding
Broiler Starter: 0.45 kg per bird (0 – 14 days of age) 
Broiler Grower: 1.10 kg per bird ( 15 – 25 days of age) 
Broiler Finisher: 1.7 kg per bird ( 26 – 35 days of age)
			Two phase feeding
Broiler Starter: 0.75 kg per bird (0 – 21 days of age)  
Broiler Finisher: 0.85 kg per bird (22 – 351 days of age)  
Designing structures
As a general guide, each bird requires an area of 0.1 square meters per bird. The length of the broiler house should run from east to west and the eastern and western sides should be built to the roof so that broilers are not exposed to direct sunlight. The fowl run should be at least 2.6 meters in height and the floors should be made of concrete. The northern and southern sides should have walls which are at least 0.5 meters high, with the remaining part covered by 9mm diamond mesh wire from where the wall ends up to the roof, for proper ventilation and yet keeping predators out. The walls should be plastered so that it is easy to clean them. For labor, a poultry run which accommodates 1000 or less broilers will require a single person to look over it.  The distance between the poultry and residential houses should be at least 50m to 100m. 



Diseases and Medicine 
This serves as a general guide, however for any complications one should visit the nearest veterinary specialist. In this blog, I will mention the most common four diseases. Please take note, if a bird dies on its own, its carcass should not be eaten, but it should be burnt. 
1. Newcastle Disease
Symptoms: breathing problems, discharge from their nose, eyes will begin to look murky. The legs and wings become paralyzed and their neck twisted.
Prevention and Treatment: To prevent it vaccinate chickens with New Castle vaccine, periodically spray your fowl run with virukill and put some in drinking water at 5mls per 5 liters
2. Fowl Pox
Symptoms: White spots on their skin, scabby sores on their combs, white ulcers in the mouth or trachea. 
Prevention and Treatment: Vaccinate with Epox or Fowl Pox that can prevent the healthy birds from contracting the disease. 
3. Botulism
Symptoms: Progressing tremors. The tremors will progress into total body paralysis which includes their breathing. Feathers will be easy to pull out and death usually occurs within a few hours.
Prevention and Treatment: Use is an antitoxin that can be acquired from a vet. You can mix 1 teaspoon of Epsom salts with 30 mls of warm water and administer to the birds by dropper once daily. 
4. Infectious Coryza


Symptoms: Heads become swollen. Their eyes will swell shut and the combs will swell. 
Prevention and Treatment: Use a vaccine called Avivac Coryza.



Waste disposal management 
Manure from broilers is a source of flies, bad smell and a good attractant of rodents. The best way to dispose of the wastes from our fowl run is to put it in our gardens or give to or sell to people with vegetable gardens.  When applying manure to the fields we must not over apply it as it will lead to the drying up of our crops. If you do not encounter too many disease outbreaks, it can be used as feed for donkeys and “road runner” chickens. However this should not be encouraged as it encourages the spread of disease to local chickens. 
Market 
Broilers can be sold directly to Manama Hospital and Manama High School, or the local business center, These broilers can be transported and sold in the cities of Bulawayo and Gwanda. I would suggest that farmers meet up and form cooperatives so that they can sell their birds one group, as this reduces transportation costs and this way they stand a chance of meeting supply demands of people who want a large number of broilers.
