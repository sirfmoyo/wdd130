        <h3>Background</h3>
        I am Freeman Moyo, from Gwanda, Mat South in Zim. I was born and bred in a rural home. I am ........................
        <div id="currentstudy"></div>
        <h3>Current studies</h3>
        <p>I am currently doing Applied Technology BS. I do not know why I ended up doing it, because I wanted to enrol for software engineering (however the degree planner the decided to give me something else). There was a time when I so badly wanted to do Bioinformatics and Biostatistics, thinking that I was going to get a scholarship in Microbiology. However, that was then, anyway, the desire for Bioinformatics planted a seed in me to learn R-language and python. So when I enrolled with BYU, I wanted to learn python (so that I easily learn R). I am a Linuxer, I last used Windows as my daily driver in 2014. However, I discovered that in Linux we do not have as many (GUI) applications as is the case with windows, so I had a desire to do software engineering so that I can make at least one (useless) Linux app. Basically those are the 2 reasons why I enrolled for this degree (to learn R and to create a Linux app)</p>

        <h3>Academic profile</h3>
        <p>Currently, I have an MSc in Microbiology and Biotechnology, and some few other certificates.</p>
        <div id="hobbies"></div>
        <h3>Hobbies</h3>
        <p>I do not have so many hobbies. I prefer keeping indoors, reading the Bible and playing around with different Linux distros. Basically I am a distro-hooper. I (used to) like trying different Linux distros and playing around with different DEs and WMs. However of late, after installing Arch, I have lost the passion for distro-hopping, implying that I am only left with one hobby, reading the Bible. I do also enjoy gardening, however, I am not that motivated to leave my room and do gardening.</p>
