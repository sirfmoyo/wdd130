                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        There are many diseases but I will only restrict myself to the four pests of economic significance.
                        Shoot fly 
                        Feeding larvae cause drying up of central leaf and dead heart symptoms in 1-4 weeks seedlings. It is controlled by timely planting, use of high seed rates. One can also use the following chemical control methods of using thionex or carbaryl.
                        Stalk borer
                        Penetrate stem through funnel at any stage of growth. Use chemicals like endosulfan, carbaryl, thionex, carbofuran.
                        Birds
                        The most common ones are the red –billed weaverbird and Quelea bird. They remove sown seeds or seed from panicle. Less damage when crop mature at same time or on extensive sorghum fields. Scaring is the answer to the problem
                        Stray livestocks
                        These cause the greatest damage and losses. These are mainly cattle, goats and donkeys. Proper fencing of the fields is the most recommended way of controlling them.

                    <p>
                        I will only cover the two most common diseases.
                        Stalk rots
                        Irregular molted pattern within internodes especially on peduncle. Crop rotations, clean cultivation and destroying residues are the recommended methods.
                        Downey mildew
                        Infected seedlings are chlorotic, stunted and may die pre maturely. Treat seed metaloxyl, deep ploughing, use resistant varieties.

                        Cereals and legumes  to consider
                        The best cereal crops for our dry and hot region are sorghum and pearl millet and finger millet as these have proven to be climate hardy crop which are grown in harsh conditions. These crops will enable us as farmers to manage their natural resource base in a sustainable manner using integrated soil fertility and crop-livestock systems management. Macia and SEgaolane are the most commonly produced sorghum varieties. ‘Local Landrace Variety’ is the best pearl millet variety. The best legumes are peanuts, groundnuts, roundnuts and cowpeas.
                        Calendar which is most suitable
                        Actual planting is done when we receive the first rains. However, pre-season ploughing (ukuphendula) should be well in advance usually in the month of October. This is necessary to mix the soil with crop residues from the previous farming season as well as to bury any manure which might have been applied. It is also important in order to bury seeds of weeds (this has been shown to reduce the incidence of weeds). 
                        Farming technologies to implement
                        There are many different planting systems available, however I recommend intercropping cereals with legumes with watermelons. This has many advantages which include, but not limited to; it has security against crop failure, helps in preventing pests and diseases to spread throughout the field, it increases soil fertility, reduces soil depletion and increases soil fertility. It reduces the need for fertilizers and it also helps in controlling weeds and controls the growth of pathogens and pests in crops. I recommend the traditional tilling system using over “ugatshompo” as these has less labour and covers more land per unit time.
                        Seed rates/ planting populations
                        For sorghum and both millet types, the recommended seed rate is 15 kg /ha (15kg is approximately a ‘bucket’) for cerals. The recommended spacing for sorghum is 75 cm between rows and 15-20 cm between plants in a row. The recommended spacing for millet is  - 75 cm inter-row and 20– 30 cm in-row. Cowpea is propagated by seed, with a seed rate of 25 kg per hectare.
                        Weed management
                        Normally 2-3 hoe-weeding regimes are is encouraged as these cereals and legumes are very sensitive to weeds.
                        Thinning
                        Thinning should be done to establish an in- row spacing of 15-20 cm and this should be done before tilling begins and is normally done 4 weeks after emergence. At this stage it is also recommended to fill in for the seeds that that did not germinate or seedlings that were affected by diseases.

                    </p>

                        Harvesting
                        Sorghum is normally harvested when plants reach physiological maturity. Leaves will be yellowish and beginning to dry up naturally. Pearl millet is ready for harvest 3- 4 weeks after flowering and it is stored unthreshed or threshed in graineries. The grain is treated with insecticides such as Malathion, Lindane.

                        For cowpeas we harvest both the leaves and seeds. For vegetables, the leaves of the cowpea plant must be young and tender; the best leaves are about the third and fourth from the apical end of the shoots. Mature seeds are usually harvested by hand. Green pods are harvested when the seed is still immature, 12–15 days after flowering. Harvest of matured pods for dry seeds are usually done by removing matured pods individually as they ripen and are spread on the ground in the homestead to dry.

                        Market 
                        These cereals are sold to local households, local millers and large companies such as Lesedi Holdings and Delta. The downside of selling to these big companies is that they usually buy large quantities of grains.

                    Legumes
                    The hyphae and spores of fungal diseases and eggs of insectpests are brought to the surface of the soil by land preparation so that they may be killed by the intense heat of the sun. The main pests during the growing season are pod sucking bugs, aphis, blister beetle and pod borer. I will cover the two most common ones.
                    Aphids
                    In most cases, it is not recommended to control aphids. These aphids are black sucking insects, which cluster around growing points, stems, leaves and flowers. If in large numbers, they can prevent normal growth. Control should only be considered where large infestations are threatening the crop or when viral infections have been observed. Several commercial pesticides such as malathion are available to control aphids, of which the most effective are systemic pesticides.
                    Bruchid
                    This is the main storage pest of cowpea. Farmers often mix cowpea grains with ash. This method is still recommended as a cheap and safe control method. To be efficient, it be should used with at least 5 % of ash. It is recommended to avoid using chemicals in stored food. If chemical control is still considered necessary, technical assistance is needed for precise advice on chemical control.
                    Diseases
                    The most important disease of cowpea is stem rot. To control this, the farmer has to improve water drainage and avoid waterlogging.

                    <p>
                        Agriculture uses up 70% of our global freshwater. It goes up to 90% in fast-developing countries.
                        70% of our planet is covered by water. However, out of 70 percent, only 2.5 percent is fresh and what is accessible for human use is 1%. 
                        According to various reports, we’ve added nearly 2.4 trillion tons of Carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Half of this huge amount was emitted in the last 35 to 50 years.  
                        Rainforests are being cut down at the rate of 100 acres per minute.
                        Soil is more than just dirt — it’s practically a living organism! One handful of healthy soil contains billions of micro-organisms that are critical to storing gases, breaking down and retaining nutrients, and growing healthy plants!
