                    Mpokiseng (Sechaba Saroona) is an initiative to make us aware of different ways of producing food in a sustainable way. Mpokiseng is a Sotho word which means assist me to thank, or make/force me to thank. Sechaba Saroona means our territory (country or community). It is with much pleasure and happiness to be interacting with you in our quest to save our environment (Sechaba Saroona), hence let us be thankful (Mpokiseng).
                    Sustainable food production mainly entails practices of producing food to meet the growing human population yet without causing harm or hurting our environment. It is our mandate as humans to be custodians of our environment, which we received as a gift from previous generations. This beautiful environment has been handed down by preceding generations to us because we are responsible enough to hand it over to future generations in a perfect state. To achieve our goal we need to:
                    Love our environment
                    Know of different agricultural production systems
                    Differentiate between production systems which harm the environment and those that protect it

                    Our environment refers to the earth or soil and rocks which form the basis of most things found within it. This earth supports many plants, it is also home to many different animals and acts as a reservoir for underground water. It is also a source of so many precious elements.
                    Our environment also consists of a plethora of different plants. Trees are a habitat to different animals and birds. They provide food to humans and animals with different foods. We (humans) use plants for constructing our homes, fencing our fields and for making kraals for our animals. Trees also provide us with medicine, firewood and we use them for constructing different structures which include but are not limited to furniture, scotch carts and whipping sticks which are used for driving animals.
                    We have our beautiful water bodies (dams and rivers). They are habitats to different animals and birds and they provide us with water for our survival and the survival of animals, both wild and domesticated ones.

                    Our community is an agro-based system, relying on animal production and crop production with few people who are formally employed. Our farming systems can be intensive or extensive animal and crop production. 

                    Intensive production systems are associated with keeping a large number of animals within a small space, or producing many crops within a small area. This involves the application of heavy external inputs such as fertilizers, animal feeds and medicines. It is also associated with producing lots of wastes, which can be disposed of in different ways, depending on what is available. Intensive agricultural production systems are good because production can be  monitored and controlled, resulting in increased output (usually within a short period of time). This means that we can get more money, hence making agriculture a source of income, not just a means of survival. The downside of intensive agriculture is that these external inputs which we usually introduce, apart from protecting our produce, they also destroy our environment, kill or harm non-target organisms. The way we dispose of our wastes is usually not good. The painful thing about intensive is that it is also practiced by those with enough capital to buy inputs, but the resulting harm is for all community members.
